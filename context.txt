"An interdimensional cleanup crew game where players use special vacuum-like tools to capture reality-warping anomalies while solving environmental puzzles that require cooperation across dimensions." that sounds decent, i would make it in the style of a horror game like lethal company or repo

That's a fantastic direction! Combining the interdimensional cleanup crew concept with horror elements like Lethal Company or GTFO would create a tense, atmospheric co-op experience. Here's how I envision it:

Interdimensional Cleanup Crew Horror Game
Game Concept: Players work as contractors for a shady interdimensional corporation that sends teams to clean up "anomalies" - dangerous reality tears that spawn horrific entities. The catch: the company cares more about profit than your safety.

Core Gameplay:

2-4 players equipped with specialized vacuum tools ("Reality Anchors") that can capture anomalies
Limited resources and equipment that must be purchased with credits earned from successful missions
Procedurally generated locations that change with each mission
Permadeath mechanics for high stakes
Horror Elements:

The anomalies warp reality around them, causing disorienting visual/audio effects
Limited visibility with players relying on handheld lights and each other's callouts
Entity AI that hunts players based on sound, light, and other factors
Tension between completing objectives and surviving
Cooperative Mechanics:

Different specialized tools that must be used in coordination (one player destabilizes anomalies, another captures them)
Players need to share limited resources like batteries, filters, and ammo
Some puzzles require players to be in different "dimensional phases" simultaneously
Voice communication is crucial, but using radios might attract entities
Progression:

Credits earned from successful missions to buy better equipment
Reputation system with the corporation that unlocks higher-risk, higher-reward contracts
Discoverable lore about what's really causing these anomalies
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this concept? For instance, I could detail the types of anomalies, the puzzle mechanics, progression systems, or the narrative elements.

I actually really like that idea, yes elaborate more

I'm excited to develop this concept further! Here's a deeper exploration of the interdimensional cleanup crew horror game:

DIMENSIONAL DECAY (potential title)
The Setting
The game takes place in a near-future where a megacorporation called "Threshold Industries" discovered "dimensional thinning" - areas where reality has become unstable due to secret experiments. These areas spawn dangerous anomalies that can spread if not contained. Your crew works for Threshold's "Containment Division," a specialized team sent to clean up these messes before the public discovers what's happening.

The Crew Roles
Players can specialize in different complementary roles:

Anchor Operator - Primary anomaly capturer who operates the main vacuum device
Scanner Technician - Detects invisible anomalies and analyzes dimensional stability
Shield Engineer - Creates temporary safe zones and reality barriers
Lure Specialist - Deploys devices that attract or repel entities
Anomaly Types
Rifts - Tears in reality that spawn entities if not closed quickly
Phantoms - Semi-corporeal beings that phase between dimensions
Distortion Fields - Areas where physics behaves unpredictably
Mimics - Entities that disguise themselves as ordinary objects
Leviathans - Massive entities that require coordinated team effort to capture
Gameplay Mechanics
Mission Structure
Briefing - Learn about the location and primary anomalies
Equipment Selection - Choose limited tools within your team's budget
Deployment - Enter the location with a time limit before dimensional collapse
Extraction - Reach the exit point before time runs out or reality fails
Dimensional Phases
The game's standout mechanic involves "phase shifting." Each location exists in multiple overlapping dimensional phases:

Players can shift between phases using limited-use "Phase Modulators"
Some anomalies are only visible or vulnerable in specific phases
Players in different phases can see ghostly outlines of each other
Certain puzzles require simultaneous actions across different phases
Communication between phases is distorted, creating tension
Resource Management
Tether Energy - Powers your dimensional equipment
Anchor Capacity - How many anomalies you can store before emptying
Phase Stability - Personal meter showing how long you can safely stay in an alternate phase
Sanity - Exposure to anomalies affects perception and control
Corporate Progression System
Complete contracts to earn credits and reputation
Unlock higher clearance levels revealing darker corporate secrets
Discover that Threshold itself may be causing dimensional instability
Eventually face the choice between continuing to work for the corporation or exposing them
Environments
Abandoned research facilities with failed experiments
Residential areas where reality has begun to break down
Natural settings where dimensional thinning has corrupted the ecosystem
Threshold corporate offices with hidden laboratories
Horror Elements
Dynamic lighting where shadows move unnaturally
Sound design where audio cues come from impossible directions
Entity AI that learns player patterns and adapts
Environmental storytelling revealing the fate of previous crews
Corporate messages that become increasingly unsettling as you learn more
Multiplayer Dynamics
If a player dies, their consciousness becomes trapped between dimensions
Dead players can still interact in limited ways, creating ghostly effects
Rescue mechanics allow living players to recover dead teammates
Communication becomes increasingly distorted the longer a mission lasts
Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this concept? Perhaps the technical implementation, specific gameplay scenarios, or the progression system?

Yes elaborate more

I'll dive even deeper into the game concept! Here's a more comprehensive breakdown of "Dimensional Decay":

CORE GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS
Anomaly Capture Mechanics
The primary gameplay loop centers around a multi-step process for anomaly containment:

Detection - Scanners reveal dimensional weaknesses through visual and audio cues unique to each anomaly type
Destabilization - Anomalies must be weakened using specialized tools before capture
Containment - The Reality Anchor vacuum must maintain a steady beam on the anomaly
Extraction - Successfully captured anomalies are stored in containment units with limited capacity
For larger anomalies, players must coordinate by:

One player maintaining a stabilization field
Another weakening the anomaly's "anchor points"
A third operating the containment beam
The fourth protecting the team from entities drawn to the energy
Environmental Hazards & Puzzles
Reality Fractures

Areas where physics behaves unpredictably (reverse gravity, time dilation, spatial looping)
Players must adapt strategies in real-time when encountering these zones
Some fractures can be temporarily stabilized for safe passage
Dimensional Locks

Security systems requiring simultaneous actions in different phases
Example: Two players must insert phase keys in different dimensions at the exact same time
Communication challenges arise as voice becomes distorted between phases
Memory Imprints

Echo-like recordings of previous events that players can interact with
Provide clues for puzzles and story elements
Some imprints can be manipulated to alter the current reality state
Equipment & Tools System
Base Equipment

Reality Anchor (primary capture tool with upgradable capacity and power)
Phase Modulator (shifts user between dimensional phases)
Tether Beacon (creates safe zones where reality is temporarily stabilized)
Echo Comm (communication device with limited battery)
Specialized Tools (unlocked through progression)

Reality Lens (reveals hidden anomalies and weak points)
Phantom Trap (temporarily contains smaller entities)
Dimensional Sealer (closes minor rifts without capture)
Anchor Override (allows capture of anomalies beyond your clearance level)
Echo Manipulator (interacts with memory imprints)
Consumables

Stability Injectors (temporarily increases phase stability)
Reality Flares (repels certain entities)
Tether Cells (emergency power source)
Phase Echo (creates a temporary decoy of the player)
PROGRESSION & ECONOMY
Mission Structure
Missions are categorized by:

Hazard Level (1-5) determining anomaly density and danger
Dimensional Instability affecting phase-shifting difficulty
Location Type influencing available resources and layout
Contract Value determining potential rewards
Economy System
Credits earned based on anomalies captured and optional objectives completed
Penalty for equipment lost or damaged during missions
Insurance options for high-risk missions
Black market dealers selling experimental equipment
Research & Development
Players can invest in:

Equipment upgrades (capacity, efficiency, durability)
Personal skills (phase resistance, carry capacity, scanning range)
Base facilities (storage expansion, enhanced mission intel, recovery services)
NARRATIVE & WORLD-BUILDING
Story Progression
The narrative unfolds across three acts:

Act 1: The Cleanup Crew

Initial contracts seem like routine cleanup operations
Gradually discover unsettling patterns in anomaly behavior
Find evidence of deliberate experiments rather than accidents
Act 2: Corporate Conspiracy

Uncover Threshold's true agenda in creating controlled breaches
Discover other crews that have gone missing
Begin receiving encrypted messages from a whistleblower
Act 3: The Source

Learn about an "Alpha Site" where the dimensional barriers were first broken
Choose between exposing the corporation or joining their true mission
Culminates in a massive operation at the source of the dimensional decay
Factions
Threshold Industries - Your employer with hidden motives
Whistleblowers - Former employees trying to expose the truth
Phase Cultists - Believe the anomalies are gateways to transcendence
Government Agents - Investigating the dimensional breaches
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Procedural Generation System
Base layouts are procedurally generated from modular pieces
Anomaly placement uses heat-map algorithms based on player progression
Environmental storytelling elements are strategically placed
Visual & Audio Design
Reality distortion effects using shader technology
Dynamic sound system where audio changes based on dimensional phase
Visual cues for danger that become more subtle at higher difficulty
Multiplayer Framework
Drop-in/drop-out capability with AI taking over disconnected players
Asymmetric abilities encouraging diverse team composition
Cross-phase communication system with increasing distortion based on phase distance
AI Director
Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on team performance
Tracks player behavior to create personalized horror experiences
Controls entity spawning and behavior based on team composition and playstyle
GAME MODES
Standard Contracts - Main mission-based progression
Emergency Response - Time-critical missions with higher rewards
Deep Dive - Multi-stage expeditions into heavily corrupted zones
Training Simulations - Practice mode with specific challenges
Breakdown Events - Limited-time special missions during reality storms
Is there a particular aspect of the game you'd like me to develop further? Perhaps the moment-to-moment gameplay experience, the horror elements, or the technical systems?

we will come back to the game aspect later, what game engine should i use? unity or unreal engine? i have a little game dev experience but not a lot, i do have a lot of programming experience. im also a very quick learner. unreal engine has more free resources like models etc. (i think) and it might be easier to make a nicer looking game without having a huge team

Given your situation, I'd recommend Unreal Engine for this project. Here's why it would be a good fit:

Visual Quality: Unreal Engine excels at creating atmospheric horror games with its advanced lighting, particle effects, and post-processing capabilities - all crucial for your interdimensional horror concept. You can achieve high-quality visuals more easily out of the box.
Blueprint System: While you have programming experience, Unreal's visual scripting system (Blueprints) can help you prototype gameplay mechanics quickly without writing code for everything, allowing faster iteration.
Free Resources: You're correct that Unreal Marketplace offers numerous free and paid assets - including quality horror game elements, sound effects, and environmental pieces that would fit your concept.
Performance Optimization: For a 3D co-op game where multiple players interact with complex environments, Unreal's performance optimization tools will be valuable.
Networking Framework: Unreal has robust built-in networking capabilities for multiplayer games, which is essential for your co-op concept.
Learning Curve: While Unreal does have a steeper initial learning curve than Unity, your programming background will help you adapt quickly. The investment in learning will pay off with the visual quality and built-in systems you'll benefit from.
If you prefer to code directly, you can use C++ in Unreal rather than Blueprints, though a combination of both is often most effective for game development teams of all sizes.

Would you like some recommendations for specific Unreal Engine resources that would help with implementing your interdimensional horror concept?

yes give more resources. also im also thinking of maybe going the lower texture way/lower poly for performance and giving it that oldschool look/ps2 filter, but also making it look nice with the ue5 and nice looking effects

I think going with a stylized low-poly aesthetic with modern lighting and effects is an excellent approach for your interdimensional cleanup crew game. This combination gives you the performance benefits of simpler models while leveraging UE5's capabilities for atmosphere. Here are resources to help you implement this vision:

Using UE5's Lumen lighting system for atmospheric effects
Adding post-processing effects like film grain, chromatic aberration, and CRT distortion for the retro look
Implementing dynamic lighting for horror elements
Creating shader effects for dimensional shifts and anomalies
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of implementing this aesthetic or the core game systems in Unreal Engine?


Do you think unity could also work?

Unity could definitely work for your project as well. Here's how it compares for your specific game concept:

Advantages of Unity for your project:

Learning Curve: Unity is generally considered more approachable for beginners while still being powerful. With your programming experience, you might find C# more comfortable than Unreal's C++.
Performance: Unity can handle low-poly games extremely efficiently, which aligns with your aesthetic direction.
Asset Pipeline: Unity's workflow for importing and managing assets is straightforward, which can speed up iteration.
HDRP/URP: Unity's render pipelines can create impressive visual effects while maintaining good performance on lower-end hardware.
Asset Store: While Unreal has more free assets, Unity's Asset Store has plenty of horror game resources, post-processing effects, and networking solutions.
Challenges with Unity for this concept:

Networking: Unity's multiplayer solutions require more setup compared to Unreal's built-in framework. You'd likely want to use Mirror or Photon for networking.
Advanced Visual Effects: Creating the dimensional effects and atmospheric lighting would require more manual work in Unity compared to Unreal.
Starting Templates: Unity has fewer ready-made templates for horror/co-op games compared to Unreal.
For your PS2-style horror game with modern effects, Unity can absolutely deliver great results. The PS2 aesthetic actually works well with Unity's default rendering and would require less performance overhead than trying to achieve ultra-realistic graphics.

The decision really comes down to which workflow you prefer and which learning curve you're more comfortable with. If you're completely new to both, Unreal might give you faster visual results, but Unity might give you more programming control from the start.

Ok, well go with unity. Help me setup a simple starting scene/testing room. I will be using a new unity asset from store that uses AI to generate 3d models. Give me the instructions and code to setup the first main "room" where we will do testing etc. Setup all the basic things we would need and test.

Setting up a test room in Unity for your interdimensional cleanup crew game is a great place to start. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a basic testing environment with the core components you'll need:

Initial Unity Project Setup
Create a new Unity project:
Open Unity Hub
Click "New Project"
Select "3D Core" or "3D URP" template (URP recommended for better visual effects)
Name it something like "DimensionalDecay" and create the project
Set up version control (recommended):
Go to Edit → Project Settings → Editor
Set Version Control Mode to "Visible Meta Files"
Set Asset Serialization Mode to "Force Text"
Initialize a Git repository for your project
Creating the Test Room
Create a basic room:
csharp
// Create a new C# script called "TestRoomGenerator.cs"
using UnityEngine;

public class TestRoomGenerator : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Room Parameters")]
    [SerializeField] private float roomWidth = 20f;
    [SerializeField] private float roomLength = 20f;
    [SerializeField] private float roomHeight = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private Material wallMaterial;
    [SerializeField] private Material floorMaterial;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        GenerateRoom();
    }
    
    private void GenerateRoom()
    {
        // Create floor
        GameObject floor = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Plane);
        floor.name = "Floor";
        floor.transform.localScale = new Vector3(roomWidth/10f, 1f, roomLength/10f);
        floor.transform.position = Vector3.zero;
        if (floorMaterial) floor.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = floorMaterial;
        
        // Create walls
        CreateWall(new Vector3(0, roomHeight/2, roomLength/2), new Vector3(roomWidth, roomHeight, 0.1f), "North Wall");
        CreateWall(new Vector3(0, roomHeight/2, -roomLength/2), new Vector3(roomWidth, roomHeight, 0.1f), "South Wall");
        CreateWall(new Vector3(roomWidth/2, roomHeight/2, 0), new Vector3(0.1f, roomHeight, roomLength), "East Wall");
        CreateWall(new Vector3(-roomWidth/2, roomHeight/2, 0), new Vector3(0.1f, roomHeight, roomLength), "West Wall");
        
        // Create ceiling
        GameObject ceiling = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
        ceiling.name = "Ceiling";
        ceiling.transform.position = new Vector3(0, roomHeight, 0);
        ceiling.transform.localScale = new Vector3(roomWidth, 0.1f, roomLength);
        if (wallMaterial) ceiling.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = wallMaterial;
    }
    
    private void CreateWall(Vector3 position, Vector3 scale, string name)
    {
        GameObject wall = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
        wall.name = name;
        wall.transform.position = position;
        wall.transform.localScale = scale;
        if (wallMaterial) wall.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = wallMaterial;
    }
}
Set up basic lighting:
Create a new GameObject and name it "Environment"
Add a Directional Light as a child if one doesn't exist
Adjust the light's color to a bluish tint for the horror atmosphere
Consider adding point lights in corners for mood
Character Controller Setup
Create a basic player controller:
csharp
// Create a new C# script called "PlayerController.cs"
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Movement Settings")]
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float lookSensitivity = 2f;
    [SerializeField] private float jumpForce = 5f;
    
    [Header("Components")]
    [SerializeField] private Camera playerCamera;
    private CharacterController characterController;
    
    private float verticalLookRotation;
    private Vector3 playerVelocity;
    private bool isGrounded;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        characterController = GetComponent<CharacterController>();
        if (playerCamera == null)
            playerCamera = GetComponentInChildren<Camera>();
        
        // Lock cursor for first-person control
        Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked;
        Cursor.visible = false;
    }
    
    private void Update()
    {
        isGrounded = characterController.isGrounded;
        HandleMovement();
        HandleLook();
        HandleJump();
    }
    
    private void HandleMovement()
    {
        float horizontalMove = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float verticalMove = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        
        Vector3 move = transform.right * horizontalMove + transform.forward * verticalMove;
        characterController.Move(move * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        
        // Apply gravity
        if (isGrounded && playerVelocity.y < 0)
        {
            playerVelocity.y = -2f;
        }
        
        playerVelocity.y += Physics.gravity.y * Time.deltaTime;
        characterController.Move(playerVelocity * Time.deltaTime);
    }
    
    private void HandleLook()
    {
        float mouseX = Input.GetAxis("Mouse X") * lookSensitivity;
        float mouseY = Input.GetAxis("Mouse Y") * lookSensitivity;
        
        // Rotate player for horizontal look
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * mouseX);
        
        // Rotate camera for vertical look
        verticalLookRotation -= mouseY;
        verticalLookRotation = Mathf.Clamp(verticalLookRotation, -90f, 90f);
        playerCamera.transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(verticalLookRotation, 0f, 0f);
    }
    
    private void HandleJump()
    {
        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && isGrounded)
        {
            playerVelocity.y = Mathf.Sqrt(jumpForce * -2f * Physics.gravity.y);
        }
    }
}
Setting Up the Player
Create the player GameObject:
Create an empty GameObject named "Player"
Add a CharacterController component
Add the PlayerController script
Create a child GameObject named "Camera" and add a Camera component
Position the camera at eye level (around 1.6-1.8 units above the player's base)
Setup vacuum mechanic (basic version):
csharp
// Create a new C# script called "RealityAnchor.cs"
using UnityEngine;

public class RealityAnchor : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Vacuum Settings")]
    [SerializeField] private float maxRange = 10f;
    [SerializeField] private float captureSpeed = 1f;
    [SerializeField] private LineRenderer vacuumBeam;
    [SerializeField] private Transform vacuumNozzle;
    [SerializeField] private ParticleSystem captureEffect;
    
    private Camera playerCamera;
    private bool isCapturing = false;
    private GameObject targetAnomaly;
    private float captureProgress = 0f;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        playerCamera = GetComponentInChildren<Camera>();
        if (vacuumBeam == null)
            Debug.LogWarning("Vacuum beam LineRenderer not assigned!");
        if (vacuumNozzle == null)
            Debug.LogWarning("Vacuum nozzle Transform not assigned!");
    }
    
    private void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            BeginCapture();
        }
        else if (Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0))
        {
            EndCapture();
        }
        
        if (isCapturing)
        {
            UpdateCapture();
        }
    }
    
    private void BeginCapture()
    {
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (Physics.Raycast(playerCamera.transform.position, playerCamera.transform.forward, out hit, maxRange))
        {
            if (hit.collider.CompareTag("Anomaly"))
            {
                isCapturing = true;
                targetAnomaly = hit.collider.gameObject;
                captureProgress = 0f;
                
                if (vacuumBeam != null)
                {
                    vacuumBeam.enabled = true;
                    vacuumBeam.SetPosition(0, vacuumNozzle.position);
                }
                
                if (captureEffect != null)
                    captureEffect.Play();
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void UpdateCapture()
    {
        if (targetAnomaly == null)
        {
            EndCapture();
            return;
        }
        
        // Update vacuum beam
        if (vacuumBeam != null)
        {
            vacuumBeam.SetPosition(0, vacuumNozzle.position);
            vacuumBeam.SetPosition(1, targetAnomaly.transform.position);
        }
        
        // Progress capture
        captureProgress += captureSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        if (captureProgress >= 1.0f)
        {
            CaptureAnomaly();
        }
    }
    
    private void EndCapture()
    {
        isCapturing = false;
        targetAnomaly = null;
        
        if (vacuumBeam != null)
            vacuumBeam.enabled = false;
        
        if (captureEffect != null)
            captureEffect.Stop();
    }
    
    private void CaptureAnomaly()
    {
        Debug.Log("Anomaly captured!");
        
        // Example of what you might do when an anomaly is captured
        if (targetAnomaly != null)
        {
            // Play capture effect
            if (captureEffect != null)
            {
                ParticleSystem effect = Instantiate(captureEffect, targetAnomaly.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
                effect.Play();
                Destroy(effect.gameObject, effect.main.duration);
            }
            
            // Destroy or disable the anomaly
            Destroy(targetAnomaly);
        }
        
        EndCapture();
    }
}
Testing Anomaly Setup
Create a test anomaly:
csharp
// Create a new C# script called "TestAnomaly.cs"
using UnityEngine;

public class TestAnomaly : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Visual Settings")]
    [SerializeField] private float pulseSpeed = 1f;
    [SerializeField] private float pulseAmount = 0.2f;
    [SerializeField] private Color anomalyColor = Color.magenta;
    
    private Vector3 originalScale;
    private Material material;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        originalScale = transform.localScale;
        
        Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
        if (renderer != null)
        {
            material = new Material(renderer.material);
            material.color = anomalyColor;
            material.EnableKeyword("_EMISSION");
            material.SetColor("_EmissionColor", anomalyColor * 2f);
            renderer.material = material;
        }
        
        // Add glow effect if using URP
        // Add a Light component for non-URP projects
        GameObject glowLight = new GameObject("AnomalyGlow");
        glowLight.transform.parent = transform;
        glowLight.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;
        Light light = glowLight.AddComponent<Light>();
        light.color = anomalyColor;
        light.range = 5f;
        light.intensity = 1.5f;
    }
    
    private void Update()
    {
        // Pulse effect
        float pulse = 1 + Mathf.Sin(Time.time * pulseSpeed) * pulseAmount;
        transform.localScale = originalScale * pulse;
        
        // Slow rotation
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * Time.deltaTime * 15f);
    }
}
Create test anomalies in the scene:
Create a few spheres in your test room
Add the TestAnomaly script to them
Tag them as "Anomaly"
Position them at different heights and locations
Integrating AI-Generated Models
Create a model loader script:
csharp
// Create a new C# script called "ModelLoader.cs"
using UnityEngine;

public class ModelLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject[] aiGeneratedModels;
    [SerializeField] private Transform[] spawnPoints;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        if (aiGeneratedModels.Length == 0)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("No AI models assigned!");
            return;
        }
        
        SpawnModels();
    }
    
    private void SpawnModels()
    {
        // If spawn points are defined, use them, otherwise spawn randomly
        if (spawnPoints.Length > 0)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < spawnPoints.Length; i++)
            {
                if (i < aiGeneratedModels.Length)
                {
                    Instantiate(aiGeneratedModels[i], spawnPoints[i].position, spawnPoints[i].rotation);
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // Spawn randomly in the room
            for (int i = 0; i < aiGeneratedModels.Length; i++)
            {
                Vector3 randomPos = new Vector3(
                    Random.Range(-8f, 8f),
                    0,
                    Random.Range(-8f, 8f)
                );
                
                Instantiate(aiGeneratedModels[i], randomPos, Quaternion.identity);
            }
        }
    }
}
Post-Processing for PS2 Style
Add the Post-Processing package:
Go to Window → Package Manager
Select "Unity Registry" from the dropdown
Find and install "Post Processing" or "Render Pipeline Core" (for URP)
Create a PS2 style shader/effect:
For URP, create a Renderer Feature
For standard pipeline, use a post-processing profile
Apply pixelation, dithering, and limited color palette effects
Final Setup
Organize the hierarchy:
Environment (containing lights, room)
Player
Anomalies
Effects
Managers (for game state, etc.)
Test the scene:
Press Play
Move around with WASD
Look with mouse
Try capturing anomalies with left mouse button
When you import your AI-generated models from the Asset Store, you'll need to:

Adjust their scale if needed
Add colliders
Tag them appropriately
Possibly adjust materials to fit your PS2 aesthetic
This will give you a solid foundation to build upon as you develop the interdimensional cleanup crew game further. Let me know if you need help with any specific aspect of this setup!
